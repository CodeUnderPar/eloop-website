        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hi, I’m Nick.</p>

        <p>
        I created E-Loop Gaming Studios as a place to build and share the games I’m developing. 
        Game development has been something I’ve wanted to pursue since middle school, and this 
        site marks the beginning of taking that goal seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
        Opportunities to work directly in the game industry aren’t easy to find where I live, 
        so instead of waiting for one, I decided to start building on my own.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’m currently developing a small card-based strategy game using Pygame. What started as 
        a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors concept gradually evolved into something more ambitious. 
        It’s a bit unconventional and doesn’t take itself too seriously, but it’s been a great 
        project for learning core systems, structure, and gameplay design.
        </p>

        <p>
        This is a long journey, and I’m building it step by step.
        </p>

        <p>
        I’ll be posting regular development updates here to document progress, challenges, 
        and lessons learned. Eventually, I plan to make the game available to download directly 
        from this site.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you’re interested in following along, feel free to check back from time to time.
